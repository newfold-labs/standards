Consistent, predictable and clear naming standards set us up for maintainable,
secure, testable and easier-to-learn codebases.

Clear and tidy code makes it easier to catch issues, onboard and collaborate with
coworkers, unlock our potential to scale and achieve the greatest possible
quality.

While we recognize Newfold Labs codebases have often come from legacy codebases
with some necessary compromises to these standards, they should be followed in
all new codebases.

We have naming standards for:

* [Projects (packages and repositories)](naming-projects.md)
* [Files and directories](naming-files-directories.md)
* [Code](naming-code.md)
* [Global namespaces](naming-global-namespaces.md)

## General principles

### Avoid inappropriate, expired and hurtful language

Strive for modern, inclusive and professional language.

* Do not use expired technical terminology, including terms with racist, ableist
  or gendered origins.
* Do not unnecessarily ascribe gendered pronouns.
* There is a time and place for humor, but good humor doesn't hurt.

If you have questions, please reach out to your manager or the Newfold Labs team.

### Jargon and data types belong in documentation

Technical jargon, description of mechanics and data types most often belong in
inline documentation and README files, not in class names, function names,
variable names or file names. If a name feels like it's describing mechanics or
technical minutiae instead of business purpose, it can likely be improved.

* `$response` over `$response_obj`
* `$theme` over `$theme_arr`
* `get_platform_config()` over `http_post_to_platform_api_for_config()`
* `update_site_log()` over `update_site_log_object_in_db()`

### Names never exist in a vacuum

Consider the names of adjacent code and products within the organization and
greater ecosystem (whether they're "well-named" or not). Names that are too
similar are a tripping hazard and confusion point.

Keep in mind not only what is currently named, but what could come in the future.

### Aim for parallel language construction

`Contact` and `About`, or `Contact Us` and `About Us`. Please don't mix and
match.

Also maintain nomenclature. Don't call the same feature "options", "tools" and
"preferences" in different places across an application interface, codebase and
documentation. Some of this is inevitable over time, but please strive to keep
API endpoints, code, interface strings and documentation in sync.

### Use appropriate pairs

Don't intermix words like `start` and `end`. Words have natural pairs.

* `begin` and `end`
* `start` and `stop` or `finish`
* `on` and `off`
* `add` and `remove`
* Don't mix CRUD with get, set, etc.

### Avoid unnecessary truncation

Visually parsing abbreviations burns daylight and makes code less readable. We're
no longer in a time where we need to conserve characters due to memory limits.

With a few notable exceptions like `ID` for `identifier`, `JS` for `JavaScript`,
and common ecosystem shorthand like `${thing}_args` in WordPress, avoid excessive
truncation. This aids adoption across skill levels and languages, and makes code
more readable.

* `$video_attributes` or `$video_meta` over `$video_attr`, `$video_att`,
  `$video_meta_atts`, etc.
* `$service_id` over `$s_id`.
* `$version` over `$ver`.

### Avoid redundancy

Calling a file `Admin_Page.php` when it's inside a folder called `/admin` creates
redundancy both in file path and PHP namespace:

* `/wp-plugin-brand/admin/Admin_Page.php`
* `WP\Plugin\Admin\Admin_Page.php`

In this case, the redundancy adds noise to process instead of beneficial clarity.

### Avoid oversimplifying

While at face value `wp-module-cache` is fairly simple and a decent name, it can
be improved. It's not very clear exactly what the codebase does. File caching?
Object caching? Fragment caching? Engineers know what caching is, but others may
not.

While `wp-module-object-cache` is more specific, consider the broader picture:

* Is it desired to have separate modules for each kind of cache?
* Are there other related features? (i.e. `wp-module-asset-minification`)

Would `wp-module-performance` be better? It's broad like `wp-module-cache`, but
talking about "the performance module" is something any stakeholder can
understand. There can be specific files for each type of caching within the
module.

#### Far from a hard rule, but a helpful framework

* Product names should be driven by business purpose.
* File and folder names driven by technology, location or feature.
* Function names driven by task.

### Spell proper nouns (brand names and product names) correctly

Always check a company or product site for the proper spelling and casing.
