Naming projects well from the beginning can prevent lots of labor to correct
down the line. Many projects grow to accommodate new requirements over time, so
while we can't predict the future and always prevent refactoring names, we can
still try to measure twice, name once.

## All packages should match their repository name

Passing a project name through `kebabCase()` should ideally always return the
repository name. And the `README.md`, `composer.json` and `package.json` names
should generally sync up (with the exception of the `@` organization prefix in
JavaScript).

## Standard

In lieu of fancy codenames and clever, aspirational abstracts, we largely follow
the following convention:

### `{platform}-{type}-{name}`

We have prescribed prefixes for many of our common product conventions below.

_Please keep reading to understand when `platform` and `type` conditionally
apply._

### Platform

The platform is the destination technology where the code executes. These may be
a specific service, library or more general language identifier.

| Tag          | Platform  |
| ------------ | --------- |
| `aws`        | Amazon    |
| `cf`         | Cloudflare |
| `gatsby`     | Gatsby    |
| `gh`         | GitHub    |
| `laravel`    | Laravel   |
| `wp`         | WordPress |
| `wp-cli`     | WP-CLI    |
| `node`       | Node      |
| `webpack`    | webpack   |
| `php`        | php       |
| `js`         | js        |
| `react`      | React     |

### Type

The type often reflects a specific classification or product name that comes from
a library or service.

* `aws-lambda-{name}`
* `cf-worker-{name}`
* `gatsby-plugin-{name}`
* `gatsby-theme-{name}`
* `gh-action-{name}`
* `wp-plugin-{name}`
* `wp-theme-{name}`

This list is not comprehensive.

### Name

The name should aim to be brief, descriptive and inclusive of potential growth,
without getting verbose, jargon-y or overly specific.

| Avoid                                          | Preferred |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `aws-lambda-headless-png-screenshot-service`   | `aws-lambda-screenshot-service` |
| `wp-module-frontend-filebased-caching`         | `wp-module-performance` |
| `wp-plugin-bluehost-support-desk-integration`  | `wp-module-support` (then added to `wp-plugin-bluehost`) |
| `gh-action-lint-build-wp-plugin`               | `gh-action-release-wp-plugin` |

### Notable exceptions

As with any standard, this helps us address about 80% of use cases.

#### Redundancies

Avoid repeating and redundant names like `satis-satis-satis` or
`cf-worker-workers` for a monorepo of workers.

Just `satis` or `cf-workers` or `cf-workers-{proxies|notifications}` suffice.

#### Cross-platform repositories

Our `scaffolding-templates` don't have just one platform or type, so both
prefixes are dropped.

#### Generally we avoid brand, company and team names in platforms

For the greatest evergreen resiliency, we typically avoid prescribing features to
specific brands, even if they're only used on a subset. This way, if another
brand needs that feature, we're not putting a `{brand}-{feature}` into a
different brand.

| Avoid                            | Preferred |
| -------------------------------- | --------- |
| `wp-module-bluehost-staging`     | `wp-module-staging` |
| `webpack-plugin-newfold`         | `webpack-plugin` (@newfold-labs/webpack-plugin) |
| `wp-module-netsol-sso`           | `wp-module-sso` (with separate netsol file) |
| `cf-worker-webcom-legacy-compat` | `cf-worker-legacy-features` (with webcom method, space for others) |

The obvious exception are our "brand plugins" whose sole purpose is serving a
single brand like `wp-plugin-bluehost`.

## Composer packages

### Standard

```
newfold-labs/{package-name}
```

Our PHP codebases are often Composer packages we distribute using Satis, and
should follow
[Composer naming conventions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#name).

## JavaScript packages

### Standard

```
@newfold-labs/{package-name}
```

This is
[essential for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#publishing-a-package)
to work correctly.

#### Note on monorepos

If JavaScript code is in a monorepo, the top-level config should follow the
standard above.

For packages inside the monorepo, they should ideally branch off the top-level
config's name.

For example:

```
@newfold-labs/node-helpers
@newfold-labs/node-helpers-mustache
@newfold-labs/node-helpers-fs
@newfold-labs/node-helpers-axios
```

However, as some libraries such as Gatsby rely on package names for some
functionality (i.e. `gatsby-theme-`), those packages are an exception to this
standard and should follow the library standards.
