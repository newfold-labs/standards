Our most stringent standards and expectations are for experiences that our
customers provide their visitors, but we strive for similar quality in our
authenticated experiences.

We expect diagnostic tools like Lighthouse and the Network tab in a browser to be
used in profiling frontend experiences.

## Semantic HTML

We expect markup to be expressed in valid, semantic HTML elements with proper
heading structure, appropriate use of anchors vs. buttons and without legacy tags
like `<marquee>`, `<b>` or `<i>`.

Beyond being more accessible and more digestible for search engines and scrapers,
there are secondary benefits as well to relying too heavily on `<div>` to divide
interfaces even when SEO isn't a factor.

One example is that in the WordPress Admin, if a third-party plugin is loading a
stylesheet indiscriminately targeting `<div>` in a way that interferes with our
specificity, simply by using `<header>`, `<section>`, `<aside>` or other semantic
tags we dodge that issue.

## Documents and DOMs

### Avoid excessive DOM size and depth

Excessive document sizes, whether transmitted in full or built after runtime,
impact browser performance and run up against memory limits of thin clients. It
doesn't matter how clever and well-formed code is, if there's simply too much of
it, the experience is poor.

* Aim for less than 1,500 DOM elements.
* Aim for tree depths less than 32 elements.
* Aim for fewer than 60 children elements per parent element.

While these are not hard limits, they are good reminders and worthy targets. In
the end, less markup is faster markup.

In WordPress, we often don't control DOM size, shape or depth, but we can be
cognizant of how our code exists within the environment.

### Batch DOM changes

If looping data to write to the DOM, batch those changes into DOM nodes that get
added with a single insertion, instead of updating the DOM during each loop
iteration.

### Buffer giant lists

Use efficient scrolling and paging techniques like list virtualization to limit
DOM elements to those only currently visible in the viewport.

## Runtime execution

### Avoid render-blocking resources

#### `<script>`

Make appropriate use of `defer` and `async`.

_In WordPress, the `script_loader_tag` filter can be used to apply per-handle._

#### `<link rel="stylesheet">`

When possible, make use of `media` to declare the media query the stylesheet
applies to so the browser can prioritize requests.

_In WordPress, the `style_loader_tag` filter can be used to apply per-handle._

### Preload, preconnect and prefetch

#### Preloading

JavaScript, CSS stylesheets, webfont files, frame documents, audio, video and XHR
requests to JSON files can be preloaded.

While not every resource should be preloaded, it's a great way to declare
high-priority assets and make them available before or early in browser
rendering.

[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload)
about using `<link>` for preloading at MDN.

#### Preconnection

Preconnection allows a browser to resolve DNS for an origin resource, often
making subsequent requests to that domain faster.

This resource hint empowers the browser to set up a connection before an HTTP
request is sent to the server, cutting down on request latency.

`preconnect` is best for resources that will always be requested, and ideal for
connecting CDNs and image services.

##### Prefer the Link HTTP header to the `<link>` tag, as it can happen prior to parsing of markup

##### Font resources must have the `crossorigin` attribute with `rel="preconnect"`

#### Prefetch

`prefetch` is a low-priority technique for resource-hinting. It instructs
browsers to fetch resources in the background during idle time and keep them in
browser cache.

There are three distinct kinds of prefetching:

* Link prefetching (i.e. /image.jpg)
* DNS prefetching (we'll get to the difference between this and preconnect)
* Prerender of documents

### Link prefetching

Link prefetching should be used sparingly, only on top-priority assets like a
company logo, or one with overwhelming certainty of being needed.

### DNS prefetching

Where `preconnect` is best for assets that will always be requested,
`dns-prefetch` performs DNS lookups during idle and has broader browser support
and therefore serves as a good fallback for browsers that don't support
preconnect.

DNS resolution is often fast, but use of `dns-prefetch` can cut 20-120ms from the
request round-trip.

### Lazy-loading images and iframe embeds

Often images and service embeds like YouTube included directly are the bulk of
the impact to performance budgets, so we look to solutions that rely on
IntersectionObserver for images or user-interaction for service embeds. However,
it is important images and video don't rapidly enter the rendered document
causing Cumulative Layout Shift, one huge contributor to the perceived
performance of a frontend. So providing placeholders, skeleton animations and
aspect ratios that are exact or very close to the final image or frame are very
important.

### Avoid excessive use of spinners and skeletons

Loading and progress states are a valuable way to communicate to users, but they
can be overdone and more distracting than helpful.

A few common issues we try to avoid:

* Multiple spinners running on a page in different cards. One or none.
* Showing a loading animation that doesn't have time to complete one or a few
  loops. This is often more jarring than impressive.
* Skeleton states that are noticeably different than the content they replace.
  The brain is busy reconciling the difference instead of focusing on the content
  when it enters.
* The dreaded progress bar that isn't fluid, accurate or, the worst offender,
  frequently jumps back.
* Short operations less than 400ms shouldn't have a spinner, progress bar or
  "pulsing skeleton state". They should be blank and rapidly fade in.
* Medium operations between 400ms and 5000ms are best to show a skeleton state
  and rapid fade in.
* Using SVG animations where CSS animations can work. SVG animations can often be
  expressed using less code in CSS, or get "SVG jank" where they stutter as the
  entire document loads, where CSS is often smoother.

## Runtime payloads

* Use efficient and modern image formats optimized by compression algorithms
* Use modern and limited quantities of webfonts, ideally variable webfonts to
  avoid multiple weights
* Minify scripts, styles and vectors

## JavaScript

### Too many dependencies

While we don't have hard performance budgets and don't believe in rebuilding the
wheel, please keep a close eye on the size of vendor dependencies and whether the
ROI for the business purpose supports the additional resource weight.

### Prefer getElementById and simple matches over querySelectorAll

Aim for the most efficient selectors when selecting DOM nodes in JavaScript.

### Prefer `mouseup` to `click`

`mouseup` fires quicker than `click` and can greatly contribute to the perceived
performance of interface interactions.

### Reads and writes to browser storage

The performance of browser local and session storage can be slow, unreliable and
limited, and require additional vendor dependencies to assure compatibility.

Browsers also limit the quantity of data that can be stored before unclear
prompts that can scare and annoy users, and these caps are for the cumulative use
by all code executing for a site.

### Efficient tapping of browser events

We expect appropriate use of `requestAnimationFrame()` and
`requestIdleCallback()` within JavaScript, debouncing at a higher cadence if
necessary and using something like IntersectionObserver for scroll observation
instead of legacy solutions with poor performance.

## Inline and linked CSS stylesheets

* Please respect user preferences for `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
* Please use `will-change` to enable browsers to serve the best experience as
  experiences morph state
* Please use `font-display` and other techniques to avoid Flash of Unstyled Text
  and avoid Cumulative Layout Shift
* Please be conscious of resource-intensive CSS properties like `box-shadow`,
  `transform`, `filter`, `position: fixed`, `border-radius` and `:nth-child`
* Avoid Base64 bitmaps or vectors when possible. Base64 is 30% larger than the
  original and parsed by the browser
* Critical CSS
* Use the `media` attribute on `<link rel="stylesheet">` to declare download
  priority for browsers when CSS is isolated by screen size
* Animation: prefer `position`, `scale`, `rotation` and `opacity`, dislike
  changes to height and width (use `transform: scale`), avoid
  `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` and instead use `transform: translate()`

## Images and embeds

* Prefer AVIF and webp to jpeg and png.
* Prefer vectors to bitmaps and icon fonts.
* Always compress assets to an optimized delivery size.
* Use `srcset` on large images to right-size the version of the asset delivered
  to various display widths.

### On YouTube, Twitter and Facebook

Embeds from popular services often can be a drag on frontend performance, so
using lazy-loading techniques on iframes, styles to help mitigate CLS and
judicious use should all be considered when using media and content embeds.

## Limit and group media queries

Media queries can be expensive to execute as a browser resizes and repaints,
including on the first paint. Knowing this, aim for the fewest possible media
queries, never leave an empty media query in stylesheets and consider using a
tool like
[postcss-combine-media-query](https://github.com/SassNinja/postcss-combine-media-query)
to combine media queries in isolated component systems.

## Leverage CDNs and subdomains

CDNs that keep assets at the edge are a common best practice for fast delivery of
static assets.

While less of an issue with HTTP/2 and greater, browsers can have a maximum
number of concurrent resource requests and with HTTP/1.1 this often maxed out at
6-8 requests per domain. By storing images and media on a different CDN subdomain
than scripts and styles, or further subdividing assets, browsers can more quickly
download resources for presentation.

## Minify assets, including HTML

Minification, removing white space, line breaks and reducing variable names so
assets are optimized for machines not readability, is an important technique in
modern development. This also goes for HTML markup delivered to browsers and in
API responses, to reduce the transmission size of documents.
