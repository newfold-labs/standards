WordPress provides registration and enqueue APIs to load JavaScript and CSS that
allow programmatic and conditional interaction with static assets.

These APIs allow for dependency management, version-based busting of
browser-cached assets and hooks for printing data from PHP for JavaScript to read
from the global `window` object.

## Never directly enqueue assets

* Always register assets globally\*
* Enqueue assets conditionally

_\*with the exception of scripts where the source is extra sensitive, or local
development assets that should be wrapped in conditional logic such that they're
not registered in production environments._

Never directly call `wp_enqueue_script()` or `wp_enqueue_style()` without first
using `wp_register_script()` or `wp_register_style()`. This allows for
programmatic override and substitution by other codebases.

Registering globally even when enqueues are conditionally scoped helps detect and
prevent race conditions of assets sharing the same handle in our products, or
third-party developers trying to debug their products while ours are running.

## Break each parameter for `wp_register_script()` and `wp_register_style()` onto new lines

Benefits:

* Easier to read, as these registrations often overrun 80 characters
* Comment out lines as you debug
* More easily track changes in version control

```php
// ❌ Don't put every parameter on a single line
\wp_register_script( 'web-admin-widget', WEB_BUILD_URL . '/index.js', apply_filters('nfd_web_admin_widget_dependencies', array('wp-element', 'wp-components', 'wp-dom-ready', 'wp-data')), $version, true );

// ✅ Break each onto a new line
$dependencies = apply_filters('nfd_web_admin_widget_dependencies', array('wp-element', 'wp-components', 'wp-dom-ready', 'wp-data'));

\wp_register_script(
    'web-admin-widget',
    WEB_BUILD_URL . '/index.js',
    $dependencies,
    $version,
    true
);
```

## Naming dependency handle slugs

* All company projects' dependency slugs should be prefixed `nfd-*`, even if
  they're third-party dependencies. _i.e. `nfd-react-router-dom`_
* **This is a global namespace.** Be defensive, clear and courteous.
* **Do not postfix `*-js`, `*-css`, `*-script` or `*-style`.** WordPress adds
  postfixes when printing assets in the DOM.
* **Keep parity between filename and dependency string.** While the `nfd-` prefix
  need not apply to the filename (though it's fine if it does), please keep
  parity between filenames and the dependency slug. Don't name a file `app.js`
  and register `nfd-module-admin-experience`.
* **Never use dynamic slugs via WordPress filters or inconsistent variables.**
  These slugs should always be static.

## Supply WordPress filter hooks for dependency assets

For the array of dependencies provided to registration functions, please wrap all
arrays, even empty ones, with `apply_filters()` and a snake-case equivalent of
the kebab-case slug and a postfix of `_dependencies`. This allows other codebases
to extend dependencies that get loaded with an asset (i.e. a brand-specific
stylesheet whenever a brand-agnostic module asset is loaded).

## First preference is given to third-party vendor assets shipped in WordPress core

In general, we prefer the use of assets that ship with WordPress instead of
bundling other equivalents, to reduce cumulative disk space and leverage assets
already browser-cached by users.

## Use environment-aware asset loading and configuration

Using
[`wp_get_environment_type()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_environment_type/)
to scope registrations and enqueue declarations for `local`, `staging` and
`production`. Passing the value of `wp_get_environment_type()` through to scripts
during runtime is also a great way to use one value across PHP and JavaScript.

### Examples

* Scope a `localhost` development server only to `local`
* Use `local` to exclude analytics logic from capturing local development
* Use `staging` and `local` to switch a version to `time()` for cache-busting
* Use `production` to switch to minified assets

## Beware bundled dependencies in other codebases

WordPress does little to prevent the collision of assets. Please prefix
third-party vendor code with `nfd` to avoid conflicts.

Instead of `react-router-dom`, use `nfd-react-router-dom`.

## Provide a version string for caching

All mission-critical assets should be tied to the codebase's semver version,
busting on every release.

Vendor code and more static assets can be locked to a specific version.

Note: the use of `filetime()`
[is not considered a reliable way](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/18227)
to cache-bust assets.

## Pass data to script at runtime

In addition to making API calls in JavaScript, it's easy to pass data directly
into the DOM for a script to take advantage of. Sometimes a new API endpoint is
overkill, it's undesirable to have a public endpoint for a sensitive operation,
or you want the response to an endpoint available immediately.

WordPress uses `wp_add_inline_script` to print inline scripts before or after the
`<script>` tag for an enqueued asset.

```php
wp_add_inline_script(
    'web-admin-widget',
    'console.log("web-admin-widget is running", window.web)',
    'before'
);
```

However, this is a great opportunity to pass data through to the application.

```php
wp_add_inline_script(
    'web-admin-widget',
    'var Newfold =' . wp_json_encode( array( 'adminUrl' => admin_url(), 'userId' => get_current_user_id() ) ) . ';',
    'before'
);
```

Finally, this is a good time to point out that you can interact with core and
custom REST endpoints in PHP.

```php
$request    = new WP_REST_Request( 'GET', '/web/v1/widget' );
$response   = rest_do_request( $request );
$server     = rest_get_server();
$data       = $server->response_to_data( $response, false );
wp_add_inline_script(
    'web-admin-widget',
    'var Newfold.apiResponse =' . wp_json_encode( $data ) . ';',
    'before'
);
```

## Conditional checks and debugging

`wp_script_is()` and `wp_style_is()` are great for scoping logic and local
development debugging, for checking for registration or whether an asset is
enqueued.

Query Monitor also lists actions firing where scripts and styles are enqueued,
but also a complete reference of enqueued scripts and styles, their dependencies
and the origin codebase where it was enqueued.
