Due to the quantity of WordPress installations we have and the distributed nature
of many of our WordPress codebases, performance is paramount to our engineering.

In our codebases, micro-optimizations can add up and unoptimized files can burden
update processes, runtime execution and our storage and bandwidth.

### Only autoload WordPress options when necessary

WordPress uses a concept of autoloading at runtime to load options from the
key-value store in the MySQL database.

If an option is required at every runtime, regardless of context, setting
`$autoload` helps WordPress craft efficient MySQL queries.

However, if an option is contextual, only necessary inside the WordPress Admin,
only necessary within a specific REST endpoint, or only necessary within a
certain scoped situation, options shouldn't autoload.

### Avoid `query_posts()`, use WP_Query or perhaps get_posts()

### Prefer `isset()` to `in_array()` when checking array keys

While `in_array()` can certainly find whether a key is within an array, it's less
efficient than doing an `isset( $array['key'] )` check. Even doing
`array_values( $array ) && isset( $array['value'] )` can be faster than
`in_array()`.

### If children aren't required on taxonomy queries, set `include_children => false`

Because WordPress terms can have hierarchical relationships, when using a
`WP_Tax_Query` consider whether child terms are necessary in the query response.
Whenever possible, set `include_children` to false if they're not needed.

### Avoid `ORDER BY RAND` in custom MySQL queries, pick a random result instead

Often it is faster to over-query a dataset and randomly pick a result using
`mt_rand()` in PHP than to use `ORDER BY RAND` in MySQL.

### Avoid short-duration crons, use short-duration transients if necessary

Regardless of whether WP-Cron is configured to run via a reliable system cron or
not, short-duration transients should always be considered first. If data expires
regularly but is only loaded conditionally, checking an expired transient likely
means fewer executions than running a cron every 10 minutes.

If system cron is configured and that condition isn't met every ten minutes, it's
running more frequently than it should. If WP-Cron is running the default way and
that condition isn't met each runtime, that code can drag a site frontend.

Crons should only be used when it's mission-critical for it to be tied to cron.

### Minimize wp_kses_*(), shortcodes and methods that rely on regex and heavy recursion

The `kses` methods that filter HTML from content, WordPress shortcodes and other
technologies lean on regex. Used lightly, their performance impact is nominal,
but used repeatedly, recursively and liberally these methods can drag on
performance.

When performing computationally expensive operations such as these, you should
always consider running some profiling to know what the performance impact is on
different samples. If expensive, consider whether the operation is a good
candidate for fragment caching.

### Cache remote request responses and expensive database queries

When interacting with remote APIs or running particularly expensive database
queries, consider how necessary realtime data is or whether the result can be
cached using the Transients API, and the cadence it needs to refresh.
