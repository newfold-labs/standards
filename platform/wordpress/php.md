WordPress has evolved a great deal since May 2003, both maintaining backwards
compatibility and leveraging new PHP language features as they became available.

A variety of coding styles and approaches developed that act as witness marks for
the era they were added.

Our standards recognize this same evolution in our own codebases, while expecting
higher quality and uniformity in new and updated code.

## Quick start

Our PHPCS ruleset extends common WordPress standards.

### 1. Require the Newfold Labs Satis repository

```bash
composer config repositories.newfold composer https://newfold-labs.github.io/satis/
```

### 2. Require the PHP standards

```bash
composer require --dev newfold-labs/wp-php-standards
```

### 3. Run the PHP linter (add to Composer scripts as "lint")

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpcs .
```

### 4. Run the automatic formatter (add to Composer scripts as "fix")

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpcbf .
```

## Minimum supported versions

See [WordPress support matrix](support-matrix.md#php).

## Prefer namespaced methods, constants and classes

While in some situations use of the global namespace is required or sensible, our
default is namespaced PHP following `PSR-4` conventions for autoloading.

We expect our WordPress code to follow
`Newfold\WP\{Plugin|Theme|Module}\{Name}`.

### Examples

```php
<?php
namespace Newfold\WP\Module\Staging;
namespace Newfold\WP\Plugin\Bluehost;
namespace Newfold\WP\Plugin\HostGator;
```

NOTE: When a brand name has explicit letter casing, like WordPress, HostGator or
WooCommerce, we always aim to preserve this casing for consistency and do not
change case to Wordpress, Hostgator or Woocommerce.

## Instantiation and autoloading

We use Composer to autoload PHP files. We prefer PSR-4 patterns, classmaps and
file references, in that order.

Keep in mind WordPress executes code from within its system of hooks and filters,
that plugins are executed in numeric-alpha order, and that most of our code
should leverage hooks and priorities to avoid inconsistencies and allow
filterability.

Finally, when manually referencing PHP files, use `include_once` and
`require_once` unless specifically leveraging the benefits of `include` and
`require`.

## Prefixing in global namespaces

Any global functions, classes or constants should be prefixed with `NFD` in the
proper kebab or snake case for the context.

_**NOTE**: This **only** applies to code in the global namespace. Code **within
our namespace** should NOT be prefixed, only things like cache and database
keys._

```php
<?php

define('NFD_PLATFORM_BRAND', 'bluehost');

apply_filters('nfd_platform_branding', 'bluehost');

wp_register_script('nfd_module_admin_widget', // ... )

function nfd_get_platform() {
    // ...
}

class NFD_Platform() {
    // ...
}
```

## Main plugin file matches project name

While WordPress supports the ability to have the main plugin file not match the
directory name, we expect the main plugin file name to mirror the directory.

```
❌ wp-plugin-bluehost/bluehost.php
❌ wp-plugin-bluehost/main.php
✅ wp-plugin-bluehost/wp-plugin-bluehost.php
✅ bluehost-maestro/bluehost-maestro.php
```

## Use `bootstrap.php` in themes, plugins and modules to isolate runtime from application scaffolding

WordPress plugins have plugin headers in their main file, WordPress themes expect
all PHP to execute from `functions.php`, but we try not to put the primary
application scaffolding or code instantiation in these files.

Instead, contain most code to a `bootstrap.php`.

### Assure loading from within WordPress

Source files should be protected from having source viewed on the server. We use
a constant WordPress defines like `WPINC` or `ABSPATH` to confirm it's WordPress
loading the source and not an HTTP request in a browser or terminal.

```php
// Do not access file directly!
if ( ! defined( 'WPINC' ) ) {
	die;
}
```

### Set PHP constants in the global namespace

Setting these constants in the main file assures the codebase always has access
to them. Many WordPress methods require a version for cache-busting, a URL for
referencing the absolute path or URL to assets, or need to know the filepath to
the main plugin file (ex: activation and deactivation hooks).

Subsequent code should be namespaced, but the primary file should execute in the
global namespace.

```php
define( '{PRODUCT}_VERSION', '1.0.0' );
define( '{PRODUCT}_URL', '' );
define( '{PRODUCT}_DIR', __DIR__ );
define( '{PRODUCT}_FILE', __FILE__ );
```

### Composer autoloading

We include Composer's autoloader here, so we know everything is available before
continuing execution.

```php
if ( is_readable( PLUGIN_DIR . '/vendor/autoload.php' ) ) {
    require_once PLUGIN_DIR . '/vendor/autoload.php';
} else {
    // Also a good opportunity for an Admin Notice or WP_Error to indicate this failed.
    return;
}
```

### Minimum version checks

We might run compatibility code within the `bootstrap.php`, but if subsequent
code will cause a fatal error in some versions of PHP or WordPress, we include
those checks as preconditions to requiring `bootstrap.php`.

```php
// Check NFD plugin incompatibilities
require_once PLUGIN_DIR . '/inc/plugin-nfd-compat-check.php';
$nfd_plugins_check = new NFD_Plugin_Compat_Check( PLUGIN_FILE );
// Defer to Incompatible plugin, self-deactivate
$nfd_plugins_check->incompatible_plugins = array();
// Deactivate legacy plugin
$nfd_plugins_check->legacy_plugins = array(
	'The MOJO Marketplace'     => 'mojo-marketplace-wp-plugin/mojo-marketplace.php',
	'The MOJO Plugin'          => 'wp-plugin-mojo/wp-plugin-mojo.php',
	'The HostGator Plugin'     => 'wp-plugin-hostgator/wp-plugin-hostgator.php',
	'The Web.com Plugin'       => 'wp-plugin-web/wp-plugin-web.php',
	'The Crazy Domains Plugin' => 'wp-plugin-web/wp-plugin-crazy-domains.php',
);
// Check plugin requirements
$pass_nfd_check = $nfd_plugins_check->check_plugin_requirements();

// Check PHP version before initializing to prevent errors if plugin is incompatible.
if ( $pass_nfd_check && version_compare( PHP_VERSION, '7.4', '>=' ) ) {
	require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap.php';
}
```

## Leverage core-supplied solutions over PHP-native and custom solutions

WordPress provides numerous internal APIs and methods that are intended to
supersede their PHP equivalents. We leverage these solutions whenever possible to
benefit from the broad environment support, security hardening and
proven-in-production peace of mind they provide.

* Use the WordPress HTTP API over Guzzle or other libraries.
* Use the WordPress Filesystem API over `file_get_contents()`.
* Use `wp_json_encode()` over `json_encode()`.

## Assume PHP that executes on the frontend may get cached

Never assume PHP will get executed on every pageload. Always assume that Newfold
or third-party vendor caching may burn markup into cache stores.

One common pain point is codebases that print WordPress nonces in the DOM. Many
caching solutions use nonces to set a cache miss, or worse burn them in and they
exceed their expiry timestamp. In general, nonces should be reserved for
logged-in WordPress users, or used on the frontend with the expectation that
error states are necessary and reliability can be an issue.

## Use defensive checks when using files, executing code and referencing keys within arrays and objects

**When requiring or including files**, `is_readable()` should be checked to avoid
fatal errors. `is_readable()` is preferred to `file_exists()` and `is_dir()`
because it goes the extra step of making sure permissions are correct for the
resource.

**When instantiating external classes or methods** that may not always be
available, use `is_callable()`. `is_callable()` is preferred to
`function_exists()` and `class_exists()` because it goes the extra step of making
sure the callback doesn't just exist but can be executed.

This is important whenever writing code that interacts with other Newfold
codebases, WooCommerce, Jetpack and code that may conditionally be available.

**When referencing object keys** we often need to use a method to check a
WordPress core object is correctly formed or that a property exists before
referencing it.

* When working with a post, page or custom post type, pass an integer ID or
  object to `get_post_type()` to assure a string response with the `post_type`.
* When working with a user, check `if ( $user instanceof WP_User )`.
* When working with object keys, use `property_exists()`, particularly when it's
  conditionally available. This may require checking a few levels in a
  multidimensional object.
* When working with arrays, use `isset( $array['key'] )` or
  `isset( $array[ X ] )` prior to referencing a key or positional item. This may
  require checking a few levels in a multidimensional array.

## Explicitly declare visibility of object properties and methods

Any callback provided to the WordPress action hooks and filter system must be a
`public` method.

However, those `public` callbacks can leverage `protected` and `private` methods,
so as a general best practice, we use PHP visibility to document intention and
good code hygiene.

Otherwise, we default to `private` visibility, stepping up to `protected` for
objects intended to be extended.

### Use strictly typed checks where possible

Whenever possible, type checks should be strict `===` vs `==`.

WordPress methods don't always return strict types, such as options, and in that
case
[typecasting](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php#language.types.typecasting)
should be leveraged.

`in_array()` isn't preferred if `isset()` can suffice for key checks, but when
`in_array()` is used the strict parameter should be set whenever possible.

### Use the WordPress Transients API over direct access to caching methods

When an object cache is in use, the Transients API handles all setting of cache
keys behind the scenes. But when an object cache is unavailable, the Transients
API gracefully falls back to the `wp_options` table.

### Avoid heredoc and nowdoc syntax

While heredoc and nowdoc syntaxes can make for easier-to-read PHP, there are edge
cases with them in different environments that can result in fatal errors.

As a general rule we avoid heredoc and nowdoc because the slight benefits do not
outweigh the risk when the edge cases go south.

### Use `?rest_route` instead of `/wp-json` in API requests

To assure our REST API requests work more often, we prefer
`domain.com?rest_route=/wp/v2/posts` to `domain.com/wp-json/v2/posts`.

This accounts for situations where WordPress' permalinks have not been set, where
[the REST prefix (`/wp-json`) has been customized](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/rest_url_prefix/)
and when there are nonstandard structures like `domain.com/index.php/wp-json`.

### Avoid excessive use of output buffers and always flush them

[PHP output buffers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.outcontrol.php) can
sometimes be a great tool in a developer's toolbelt, but failing to flush a
buffer can have undesirable results, so we expect `ob_get_clean()`,
`ob_get_flush()` or other methods of emptying the output buffer to be used.

### Don't use PHP sessions

This is a hard rule. Never, under any circumstances, leverage PHP sessions in
WordPress codebases. There are substantial security and experience issues to
overcome even when you control the environment completely, and we do not.

## Aim for efficient database queries

WordPress supplies a number of performance-optimized, cache-supported,
security-conscious objects to query data in the MySQL database including:

* `WP_Query`
* `WP_User_Query`
* `WP_Comment_Query`
* `WP_Term_Query`
* `WP_Tax_Query`
* `WP_Date_Query`
* `WP_Meta_Query`

We lean on these queries for security hardening and the caching benefits they
enable, in lieu of other core methods like `get_posts()` and `get_users()`.

### Narrowly scope WP_Query and internal queries

* Never use unbounded or unlimited queries (i.e. `posts_per_page => -1`).
* Limit fields with `fields` arguments, particularly for large queries.
* Disable meta and term caches when they're not necessary.
* Use `no_found_rows => true` for unpaginated queries.
* Avoid multi-dimensional queries (`{term}__and` and `{term}__not_in`) and
  queries that require multiple table lookups via joins.

### Aim for single-purpose functions

In procedural code like WordPress, it's easy to create sequential logic in a
single function.

One of the best ways to make reusable code is putting tasks into helper functions
that get composed into a sequence.

When a single method is used to read data, and another to write, instead of a
half-dozen calls to the same WordPress option, it makes future iteration, data
migration and edge cases easier to address, as the logic happens in one or two
places instead of needing to be duplicated into a half-dozen or dozen places.

```php
// This method could be split into helper methods that can help reduce repetitive code
// as the application grows and evolves.
function get_data() {
    $data = get_transient('nfd_cached_response');
    if ( false === $data ) {
        $raw_response = wp_remote_get('https://domain.com/api/resource');
        if ( 200 === wp_remote_retrieve_response_code( $raw_response ) ) {
            $data = wp_remote_retrieve_response_body( $raw_response );
            if ( is_array( $array = json_decode( $data, true ) ) ) {
                set_transient('nfd_cached_response', $array, 20 * MINUTE_IN_SECONDS );
            }
        }
    }

    return $data;
}
// instead, isolating the logic allows for more robust and reusable code
class Cached_API_Data {
    public static $key = 'nfd_cached_response';
    public static $endpoint_path = 'https://domain.com/api/resource';

    public static function get() {
        $data = get_transient( static::$key );
        if ( false === $data ) {
            $data = static::remote_request();
            // if is_wp_error() retry X times, etc.
        }

        return $data;
    }

    public static function remote_request() {
        $raw_response = wp_remote_get(static::$endpoint_path);
        if ( ! is_wp_error( $raw_response ) && 200 === wp_remote_retrieve_response_code( $raw_response ) ) {
            $data = wp_remote_retrieve_response_body( $raw_response );
            if ( is_array( $array = json_decode( $data, true ) ) ) {
                static::cache( $array );
                return $array;
            }
        }

        return new \WP_Error( 'slug-for-error', __('Error message', 'text-domain') );
    }

    public static function cache( $data, $duration = 20 * MINUTE_IN_SECONDS ) {
        set_transient( static::$key, $data, $duration );
    }

    public static function delete() {
        delete_transient( static::$key );
    }
}
```
