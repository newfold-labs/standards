From jQuery, Backbone and Gulp, to React, Lodash and webpack, JavaScript in
WordPress has evolved a lot over time, and sometimes the old and the new both
need to coexist.

This guide primarily covers the more modern JavaScript in WordPress.

## Not the JavaScript way, the WordPress JavaScript way

Many traditional modern JavaScript projects manage assets and loading techniques
differently than how JavaScript is handled inside WordPress.

A few key differences:

### Abstractions

WordPress ships with React, a Redux-like store, and a babel runtime, but you
don't `import React from 'react'`, the Redux-like store is `@wordpress/data` and
the babel runtime is called `wp-polyfill`.

Most notably, WordPress has abstracted React as `@wordpress/element`. In part
[due to past licensing issues](https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/), in
part to add some WordPress-specific features and exclusions (no `createClass` and
`PropTypes`) and in part to mitigate migration risk if the project ever chose to
pivot to Preact, Vue or other future frameworks.

### Dependency management

Often, vendor dependencies in a traditional JavaScript application are handled
entirely by webpack or a build process. This build process might create a vendor
bundle or isolate groups of dependencies by other methodologies. However, in
WordPress, many isolated codebases need to coexist and interact.

In WordPress, vendor dependencies are managed in PHP by a system of methods for
registering and enqueuing scripts, styles and webfonts. This allows core, plugins
and themes to share scripts and styles without tons of duplicate copies. In
JavaScript, modules and methods are made available to the `window` global. Often
WordPress-specific code is available from `window.wp`, so `window.wp.element.render()`
is where you can tap into `React.render()`.

In precompiled source files, solutions like
[`@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin)
translate ES2015+ JavaScript `import` statements into a PHP `array()` of strings
that map to the registered asset in WordPress, so you can write modern JavaScript
that compiles down to build files ready for WordPress' unique JavaScript
environment.

```js
import { render } from '@wordpress/element';
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n';
```

Will get extracted as:

```php
array(
    'dependencies' => array(
        'wp-element',
        'wp-i18n',
    )
)
```

_Note: WordPress has been phasing out Lodash as a bundled dependency. Prefer
native JavaScript equivalents (e.g. `Array.prototype.filter()`, `Object.keys()`)
over Lodash utilities._

Then:

1. A script that uses WordPress' registration system declares that dependency
   array.
2. WordPress automatically enqueues those assets prior to loading the custom
   script.
3. webpack will have resolved `@wordpress/element`, lodash and other bundled
   vendor packages using webpack `global` where it can tap into the module.

### Included WordPress packages and third-party vendor dependencies over bring-your-own

One natural tension in WordPress JavaScript development is whether to use
included WordPress packages and vendor dependencies, or whether to add custom
ones.

Often the wisest and safest path is to leverage what's included, even if you
think you can bring something that improves on the WordPress version.

Sometimes WordPress doesn't include something, or there's a strong reason to use
another solution, but in this case it's important to inspect scripts and
stylesheets for potential collision. Particularly with stylesheets, WordPress
applies CSS to top-level element selectors like `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>` that
may conflict with components using a class-based selector system and expect to
run in a more pristine environment.

#### Reference: [WordPress/gutenberg packages](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages)

#### Caching

WordPress' component library is loaded in instances of the Block Editor, and
often cached in a user's browser or perhaps an edge CDN the site is leveraging.

Using WordPress assets makes your application and WordPress itself faster and
lighter because the asset gets cached on CDN and/or browser for future requests.

#### Compatibility

WordPress' component library is designed to work within the WordPress Admin, an
environment with 19 years of core stylesheet specificity and potentially dozens
of custom stylesheets. It's never impossible to avoid conflict, but third-party
authors often test with WordPress where they don't test with all third-party
WordPress solutions.

From a script standpoint, WordPress' components are tested to be compatible with
WordPress and avoid conflicts like two scripts tapping into the global namespace,
i.e. expecting `window.apiUrl` to be available.

#### Performance and file size

Due to the nature of shared hosting and creating distributed products, a 100kb
dependency gets multiplied millions of times, so using something existing is a
micro-optimization that translates into a measurable impact on general delivery,
update package payloads as well as disk space.

## Making lazy-loaded assets work in WordPress

Modern React has some great features like `<Suspense>` and `React.lazy()` that
allow us to build code-split monoliths with isolated code. These features can
pretty easily be made to work in WordPress, but they don't work in
`@wordpress/scripts` out of the box. These assets also fall outside WordPress'
dependency system and need a way to be cache-busted between releases.

### 1. Add a `webpack.config.js` to your project

Change the output directory to a versioned folder and use `webpack-merge` or
object spreading to rebuild the config.

`{root}/webpack.config.js`

```js
const path = require('path');
const wpScriptsConfig = require('@wordpress/scripts/config/webpack.config');
const version = require('./package.json').version; // never require the entire config
const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');

const newConfig = {
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'build/' + version)
    }
}

module.exports = merge(wpScriptsConfig, newConfig);
```

### 2. Register your assets with WordPress

In addition to registration, we'll need to make the runtime URL for the versioned
build folder available.

```php
$build_dir = PRODUCT_DIR . '/build/' . PRODUCT_VERSION;
$build_url = PRODUCT_URL . '/build/' . PRODUCT_VERSION;
$asset_file = $build_dir . '/admin.asset.php';

if ( is_readable( $asset_file ) ) {
    $asset = include_once $asset_file;
} else {
    return;
}

wp_register_script(
    'nfd-admin',
    $build_url . '/admin.js',
    $asset['dependencies'],
    $asset['version'],
    true
);

wp_add_inline_script(
    'nfd-admin',
    'var nfdProductPublicPath =' . wp_json_encode( $build_url ) . ';',
    'before'
);
```

### 3. Before rendering your React app, set the webpack public path variable

```js
if( 'undefined' !== typeof window.nfdProductPublicPath ) {
    __webpack_public_path__ = window.nfdProductPublicPath;
}
// ...
render(
    mountPoint,
    <App />
);
```
