Newfold modules are self-contained pieces of functionality that can be used to
extend the functionality of a brand plugin. Modules are developed in their own
repositories and are installed as dependencies of brand plugins.

## Expectations

* A single team will be responsible for the development and maintenance of a
  specific module. This team is referred to as the "module owners".
* The module owners are responsible for requesting an architectural review from
  the WordPress COE team in the early stages of any new development.
* The module owners are responsible for following the
  [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
  branching model and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) when developing
  and releasing the module.
* The module owners are responsible for overseeing all code reviews and releases
  within their module repository.
* The module owners are responsible for writing tests for all new functionality
  and updating tests for existing functionality. Currently, these tests are to
  live in the module repositories.
* The module owners are responsible for creating and testing **pre-releases** of
  the brand plugins that use the module.
* When the module owners determine that a module release and brand plugin
  pre-release is ready for production, it is their responsibility to create a PR
  against the brand plugin's `develop` branch to update the module version.

## Workflow

The following is a high-level overview of the workflow for developing and
releasing a module.

### Pre-development

* The module owners should request that the WordPress COE team create a
  repository for your module in the Newfold Labs GitHub organization.
* The module repository should be scaffolded before development starts. This can
  be done by the module owners or the WordPress COE team.
* The module owners will need to request that the WordPress COE team add any
  GitHub secrets to the module repository in order to use the GitHub Actions
  workflows.
* The module owners will need to request an
  [architectural review](../../process/architectural-review.md) from the
  WordPress COE team before a new module is allowed to be released.
* After a successful architectural review, the module owners follow the
  development flow in the next section.

### Development

1. Do all development work in feature branches in the module repository,
   following the branch naming conventions on the
   [Git and branching](../../general/git.md#branch-naming) page. Be sure to start
   all feature branches from the `develop` branch.
2. Create a pull request against the `develop` branch in the module repository
   when a feature branch is ready for review, and merge it only when automated
   checks pass and at least one other developer approves it.
3. Once all features are in the `develop` branch, start preparing for a release.
4. Create a release branch from the `develop` branch, following the branch naming
   conventions on the [Git and branching](../../general/git.md#branch-naming)
   page.
5. Tag a pre-release version (e.g. `1.0.0-rc.1`) on the module repository.
6. Test the pre-release locally.
7. Create a feature branch on any applicable brand plugin repositories, update
   the module version to the pre-release version, implement any additional
   integrations, and verify proper coverage via automated tests.
8. Tag a pre-release on the brand plugin repository (e.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1`) for
   your feature branch, and test the alpha release using the build created via
   GitHub Actions. **Be sure to check the "Set as a pre-release" checkbox when
   creating the release.**
9. If issues are found in the module, create a new PR against the release branch
   in the module repo with any required fixes, repeat steps 5-8 and be sure to
   increment the release candidate version.
10. If issues are specific to the brand plugin, apply any fixes to the feature
    branch in the brand plugin repo and repeat steps 8-9, making sure to
    increment the pre-release version.
11. If no issues are found, merge the release branch in the module repository
    into the `main` branch, tag a new production release (e.g. `1.0.0`) and
    update the feature branch in the brand plugin(s) to use the new release.
12. Create a new pull request from the feature branch in the brand plugin against
    the `develop` branch. Select at least 2 members of the WordPress COE team as
    reviewers, and notify the WordPress COE team in the `General` channel of the
    `Press 1, 2, 4 Coordination` team in Microsoft Teams.

At this point, your PR has been officially submitted. Code must be submitted by
Wednesday the week before a release is scheduled to go out in order to make it
into that release. If any issues are found, the WordPress COE team may request
changes to the PR. If the PR is not ready to be merged by the end of the week, it
will be pushed to the next release.

Keep in mind that the WordPress COE team will **NOT** conduct a full code review
of the PR unless you specifically request it. However, they will review the PR
for any obvious issues such as failing tests, missing tests, missing
documentation, failing or missing GitHub Action checks, etc.
